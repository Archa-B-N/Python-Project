#  Exploratory Data Analysis of Employees Working in ABC Company

## Introduction

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information about 458 NBA (National Basketball Association) players, initially perceived as employees working in ABC company.The dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns.

## Problem Statement

The company needs a detailed report and explanation of their employees in each team. The objectives of this project are:

1. How many employees are there in each team, and what is the percentage splitting with respect to the total employees?
2. Segregate the employees with respect to different positions.
3. Find from which age group most of the employees belong.
4. Find out under which team and position the spending in terms of salary is high.
5. Find if there is any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.

## Methodology

The methodology used in this project involves:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Data visualization and exploration
3. Statistical analysis and modeling

## Preprocessing Steps

1. Importing required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
2. Missing-data handling: rectified the variable "Height" to "date" and added a column "height" with random numbers within the range of 150 to 180

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning refers to the process of removing unwanted variables and values from our dataset and getting rid of any irregularities in it.

## Team Analysis

1. Find the number of teams (30) where each employee exists, count the most number of employees belonging to which team, etc.
2. Visualize the team distribution using a bar chart for meaningful and easiest insight.

## Position Segregation

1. Count the number of positions in the dataset and calculate the employee count in each position.
2. Visualize the position distribution using a count plot for the best insight.

## Age Group Identification

1. Identify the predominant age group among employees.
2. Visualize the corresponding distribution using histogram.

## Salary Analysis

1. Determine the team and position of employees with the highest salary spending.
2. Visualize the salary distribution by using bar chart and heat map.

## Correlation between Age and Salary

1. Analyze the relationship between employees' age and their corresponding salaries.
2. Discover the correlation through a scatter plot.

## Conclusion

In summary, the Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset has yielded important new information about the properties of the dataset. We investigated correlations between variables, identified outliers, and obtained knowledge of the distribution of important features using statistical summaries and visualizations.
